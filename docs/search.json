Following new EU transparency regulations and subsequent political ad bans by Meta and Google, attention in the Dutch political advertising landscape has shifted again toward traditional media channels which now have to provide increased public transparency.\nFor social media advertising data (Meta/Google) up until the ban, see the Who Targets Me Dashboard.\nLast Updated: October 30, 2025 at 09:56 CET"

Political advertisers submit declarations in one place for all participating media companies, covering TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor, and online advertising. It seems to be the most comprehensive repository for political advertising in the Netherlands, however it is not standardized across advertisers and also missing key information (e.g. which data and parameters were used). Here we show the total value (i.e. including pre-publishing costs). Total spend on just the distribution are: €9 885 011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSter Transparency\n€4 489 112\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this source\n▼\n\n\nSter is the advertising sales organization for Dutch public broadcasting (NPO).

Their transparency page lists political advertising campaigns on their print and digital channels. Each entry shows the advertiser, campaign period, spending range (brackets like \"&lt; €1,000\" or \"€1,001-10,000\"), and estimated reach. DPG Media reports spending boundaries rather than exact amounts, with a maximum category of \"&gt; €10,001\", meaning only estimates are possible.

Out of 65 total campaigns, only 43 campaigns (66%) report which channels they used. The remaining 22 campaigns (34%) don’t specify any channels.

    "text": "Political Advertising Transparency in the Netherlands\nAs of October 10, 2024, new European Union regulations on political advertising transparency came into force across all EU member states. These rules require that political advertisements are clearly labeled, disclose their financing sources and targeting methods, and prohibit the use of sensitive personal data (such as ethnicity or religion) for targeting purposes without explicit consent.\nIn response to this evolving regulatory landscape, major Dutch media companies launched politiekereclame.nl as a centralized platform where political parties and organizations can submit transparency statements for their advertising campaigns. This initiative aims to simplify compliance with EU regulations while strengthening public trust in political advertising.\nHowever, available datasets diverge significantly in their scope, methodology, and coverage. This dashboard brings together three major data sources—each with distinct strengths and limitations—to provide the most comprehensive overview of political advertising spending in the Netherlands leading up to the 2025 parliamentary elections."
